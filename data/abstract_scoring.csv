1,10.1101/19005710,"Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to determine which age groups drive an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission, even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data is noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5-19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the US. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.",Copied,NA,1,0.043181818,keep,110,0.047727273,0,0,3,0,1,29508,medrxiv,19/09/2019,FALSE,Symbolic transfer entropy reveals the age structure of pandemic influenza transmission from high-volume influenza-like illness data,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,cc_by_nc_nd,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,epidemiology,"Kissler, S.

Previous UK Biobank studies have only shown limited evidence for population-level cognitive differences associated with probable MDD. Here, we used an updated range of cognitive tasks and clinical assessment criteria in UK Biobank to investigate whether there are differences in cognitive function associated with lifetime MDD. Methods. Associations between lifetime MDD and cognition (performance on six tasks and a general (g) factor) were investigated in UK Biobank (N range 7,457-14,836, age 45-81 years, 52% female), adjusting for demographic, education and lifestyle. Classification of lifetime MDD was based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF). Within the lifetime MDD group, we additionally explored relationships between cognition and (i) recurrent MDD, (ii) current MDD symptoms, (iii) severity of psychosocial impairment (while symptomatic), and (iv) concurrent psychotropic medication use Results. Lifetime MDD was robustly associated with a lower g-factor (? = -0.10, q = 4.7?10-5), with significant impairments in attention, processing speed and executive functioning (? ? 0.06). Analysis within the lifetime MDD group indicated that case individuals with severe psychosocial impairment had significantly lower g-factor (? = -0.14, P = 1.5?10-2), with greatest impairments in reasoning (? = -0.18, q = 7.5?10-5). Other clinical characteristics showed differential profiles of cognitive impairment across cognitive domains. Conclusions.

3,10.1101/19006171,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Previous genetic and epidemiological studies have shown that the AMD progression are affected by genetic variants and environmental factors. AMD severity is mainly diagnosed by color fundus images and recent studies have shown the success of machine learning methods in predicting AMD progression using image data. However, none of the studies have utilized both genetics and image data for predicting AMD progression. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large-scale clinical trial from the National Eye Institute, includes massive genome-wide genotyping data, longitudinal color fundus photographs, and disease severity assessment over a period of 12 years, providing an unprecedented opportunity to investigate prediction models for AMD progression. In this report, we jointly used genotypes and fundus images to dynamically predict an eye as having progressed to late AMD (e.g., whether the time to progression to late AMD for the eye exceeds 3 years from the current visit) with a modified deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In total, we used 31,262 color fundus images centered on the macula from 1,351 subjects with corresponding genotypes and phenotypes available at baseline and follow-up visits. The first part of this model was derived from a CNN to extract features. Our results showed that the color fundus photos coupled with genotypes could predict late AMD progression with an averaged area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.83-0.86). The results using fundus images alone showed an AUC of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.80-0.83). We have validated our results in an independent dataset of 200 Caucasians extracted from UK Biobank and the results showed an AUC of 0.9 (95%CI: 0.85-0.94) for predicting whether the eye progresses to late AMD exceeding the 3 years.

Recent years have seen a substantial decline in the number of globally reported cases, largely driven by an intensive process of screening and treatment. However, this infection is highly focal, continuing to persist at low prevalence even in small populations. Regional elimination, and ultimately global eradication, rests on understanding the dynamics and persistence of this infection at the local population scale. Here we develop a stochastic model of gHAT dynamics, which is underpinned by screening and reporting data from one of the highest gHAT incidence regions, Kwilu Province, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We use this model to explore the persistence of gHAT in villages of different population sizes and subject to different patterns of screening. Our models demonstrate that infection is expected to persist for long periods even in relatively small isolated populations. We further use the model to assess the risk of recrudescence following local elimination and consider how failing to detect cases during active screening events informs the probability of elimination.

6,10.1101/19006577,"Background: There is a wealth of literature on the observed association between childhood trauma and psychotic illness. However, the relationship between childhood trauma and psychosis is complex and could be explained, in part, by gene-environment correlation. Methods: The association between schizophrenia polygenic scores (PGS) and experiencing childhood trauma was investigated using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Schizophrenia PGS were derived in each cohort for children, mothers, and fathers where genetic data were available. Measures of trauma exposure were derived based on data collected throughout childhood and adolescence (0-17 years; ALSPAC) and at age 8 years (MoBa). Results: Within ALSPAC, we found a positive association between schizophrenia PGS and exposure to trauma across childhood and adolescence; effect sizes were consistent for both child or maternal PGS. We found evidence of an association between the schizophrenia PGS and the majority of trauma subtypes investigated, with the exception of bullying. These results were comparable in MoBa. Within ALSPAC, genetic liability to a range of additional psychiatric traits was also associated with a greater trauma exposure. Conclusions: Results from two international birth cohorts indicate that genetic liability for a range of psychiatric traits is associated with experiencing childhood trauma.

7,10.1101/19006635,"Purpose: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by loss of the functional SMN1 gene but retention of the paralogous SMN2 gene, is a leading genetic cause of early childhood death. Due to the near identical sequences of SMN1 and its paralog SMN2, analysis of this region by standard NGS-based pipelines has been challenging historically. Preconception population-wide SMA screening of potential parents to quantify the copy number (CN) of SMN1 is recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. Methods: We developed a novel informatics method that accurately identifies the CN of SMN1 and SMN2 using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This algorithm calculates the CNs of SMN1 and SMN2 using read depth and eight informative reference genome differences between SMN1 and SMN2. Results: We characterized SMN1/2 in a total of 12,747 genomes sequenced to high depths (>30x) across five ethnic populations. Across these samples we identified a total of 251 (1317) samples with whole gene losses (gains) of SMN1 and 6241 (374) samples with losses (gains) of SMN2. We calculated a pan-ethnic carrier frequency of 2%, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, we validated our CN calls and showed that all (48/48) SMN1 and 98% (47/48) of SMN2 CN calls agreed with those measured with digital PCR. Conclusion: This WGS-based SMN copy number caller can be used to identify both carrier and affected status of SMA, enabling SMA testing to be offered as a comprehensive test in neonatal care and also an accurate screening tool for carrier status in large-scale WGS sequencing projects.",Copied,NA,0,0.571783056,keep,982,0.334278625,3,4,2,0,1,29561,medrxiv,02/10/2019,FALSE,Spinal muscular atrophy diagnosis and carrier screening from whole-genome sequencing data,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,cc_by_nc_nd,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,genetic and genomic medicine,"Chen, X.; Sanchis-Juan, A.; French, C.

8,10.1101/19006650,"Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show heterogeneous treatment response and highly variable clinical trajectories: while some patients experience swift and enduring recovery, others show relapsing-remitting or chronic disease course. Predicting individual clinical trajectories at an early disease stage is a key challenge for psychiatry and might facilitate individually tailored interventions. So far, however, reliable predictors at the single-patient level are absent. Here, we evaluated the utility of a machine learning strategy - generative embedding - which combines an interpretable generative model with a discriminative classifier. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of emotional face perception in 85 MDD patients from the multi-site longitudinal NEtherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) who had been followed up over two years and classified into three subgroups with distinct clinical trajectories. Combining a generative model of effective (directed) connectivity with support vector machines (SVMs), it was possible to predict whether a given patient will experience chronic depression vs. fast remission with a balanced accuracy of 79%. Gradual improvement vs. fast remission could still be predicted above-chance, but less convincingly, with a balanced accuracy of 61%. Importantly, generative embedding outperformed conventional (descriptive) measures such as functional connectivity or local BOLD activity, which did not predict clinical trajectories with above-chance accuracy. Furthermore, the predictive performance of generative embedding could be assigned to a specific network property: the dynamic modulation of connections by the emotional content of the trial-by-trial stimuli.

10,10.1101/19006957,"Background The English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is widely used as a measure of deprivation of geographic areas in analyses of health inequalities between places. However, similarly ranked areas can differ substantially in the underlying subdomains and indicators that are used to calculate the IMD score. These subdomains and indicators contain a richer set of data that might be useful for classifying local authorities. Clustering methods offer a set of techniques to identify groups of areas with similar patterns of deprivation. This could offer insights into areas that face similar challenges. Methods Hierarchical agglomerative (i.e. bottom-up) clustering methods were applied to sub-domain scores for 152 upper-tier local authorities. Recent advances in statistical testing allow clusters to be identified that are unlikely to have arisen from random partitioning of a homogeneous group. The resulting clusters are described in terms of their subdomain scores and basic geographic and demographic characteristics. Results Five statistically significant clusters of local authorities were identified. These clusters represented local authorities that were: (i) Most deprived, predominantly urban; (ii) Least deprived, predominantly rural; (iii) Less deprived, rural; (iv) Deprived, high crime, high barriers to housing; and (v) Deprived, low education, poor employment, poor health. Conclusion Hierarchical clustering methods identify five distinct clusters that do not correspond closely to quintiles of deprivation.

11,10.1101/19007013,"Importance: Previous literature has demonstrated a strong association between cigarette smoking and suicide-related behaviours, characterised as ideation, plans, attempts and suicide related death. This association has not previously been examined in a causal inference framework and has important implications for suicide prevention strategies. Objective: We aimed to examine the evidence for an association between smoking behaviours (initiation, smoking status, heaviness, lifetime smoking) and suicidal thoughts or attempts by triangulating across observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. Design: First, we estimated observational associations between smoking behaviours and suicidal thoughts or attempts using data from the UK Biobank cohort. Second, we conducted MR using both individual level and summary level methods. MR uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to reduce bias from residual confounding and reverse causation. Setting: The observational analysis and individual level MR were conducted using the UK Biobank, a cohort study that recruited from study centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Summary level MR analyses used summary data from previously published genome-wide association studies conducted in individuals of European ancestry. Participants: 337,053 individuals from the UK Biobank aged from 39 to 70 years at recruitment (mean = 56.91 years, SD = 7.99 years) and 54% of the sample were female.

The MR analysis and single SNP analysis, however, did not support this. Despite past literature showing a positive dose-response relationship our results showed no clear evidence for a causal effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours.

TRD and non-responders did not show higher risk to carry damaging variants compared to responders. Genes/pathways associated with TRD included those modulating cell survival and proliferation, neurodegeneration and immune response. Significant prediction of TRD vs. response was observed in the testing sample which was improved by the addition of clinical factors. Some models were replicated, with a weaker prediction, in STAR*D and GENDEP when considering also clinical factors and in the extremes of the genetic score distribution.

Despite its serious complications,limited evidence is available on the magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patient with diabetes mellitus. Hence the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Africa. Methods: PubMed Scopus Google Scholar Africa journal online WHO afro library and Cochrane review were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. Heterogeneity across the included studies was evaluated by inconsistency index (I2). Publication bias was examined by funnel plot and Egger regression test. The random-effect model was fitted to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes mellitus patients. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for windows. Results: Twenty-three studies which comprises of 269 691 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 46% (95% CI:36.21-55.78%). Based on the subgroup analysis the highest magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was reported in West Africa 49.4% (95% CI: 32.74, 66.06). Conclusion: This study revealed that the overall prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is relatively high in Africa. Hence, diabetic peripheral neuropathy needs situation based intervention and preventive strategy depending on their country context.

16,10.1101/19007542,"Background: Recent years have seen a growing interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelic substances for the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients with affective and mood disorders. Neuroimaging studies have just begun to explore how brain networks supporting perceptual and higher-order cognitive and emotional functions are affected during the acute effects of psychedelics. Even less is known on the neural correlates of the subacute effects taking place one to a few days after the psychedelic experience. This study explores the subacute changes of primary sensory brain networks and networks supporting higher-order affective and self-referential functions after a single session with the psychedelic ayahuasca. Methods: We leveraged task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data one day before and one day after a randomized placebo-controlled trial exploring the effects of ayahuasca in naive healthy participants (21 placebo/22 ayahuasca). We derived functional connectivity maps of the salience, default mode, visual and sensorimotor networks using a seed-to-whole brain connectivity approach, and statistically assessed post-session functional connectivity changes between the ayahuasca and placebo groups. Connectivity changes were subsequently associated with scores of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale assessed during the acute session. Results: Our findings revealed increased functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex of the salience network and decreased functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex of the default mode network one day after the session in the ayahuasca group. No connectivity changes between groups were found in primary sensory networks. Subacute increased connectivity of the salience network correlated positively with altered somesthesia scores assessed during the acute effects of ayahuasca, while decreased connectivity of the default mode network correlated negatively with altered volition scores.

The analysis compared the diagnosis of AD as an outcome measure in patients receiving at least one prescription for a TNF blocking agent (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) or for methotrexate. RA increased the risk for AD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.06, 95% Confidence Interval: (2.02-2.10), P-value <0.0001) as did psoriasis (AOR = 1.37 (1.31-1.42), P <0.0001), ankylosing spondylitis (AOR = 1.57 (1.39-1.77), P <0.0001) , inflammatory bowel disease (AOR = 2.46 (2.33-2.59), P < 0.0001), ulcerative colitis (AOR = 1.82 (1.74-1.91), P <0.0001), and Crohn's disease (AOR = 2.33 (2.22-2.43), P <0.0001).

Methotrexate also reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AOR = 0.64 (0.61-0.68), P <0.0001), while further risk reduction was achieved in patients with a prescription history for both a TNF blocker and methotrexate. Etanercept and adalimumab also reduced the risk for AD in patients with psoriasis: AOR = 0.47 (0.30-0.73 and 0.41 (0.20-0.76), respectively.

18,10.1101/19007773,"Objective. To determine whether naturally occurring autoantibodies against the prion protein are present in individuals with genetic prion disease mutations and controls, and if so, whether they are protective against prion disease. Methods. In this case-control study, we collected 124 blood samples from individuals with a variety of pathogenic PRNP mutations and 78 control individuals with a positive family history of genetic prion disease but lacking disease-associated PRNP mutations. Antibody reactivity was measured using an indirect ELISA for the detection of human IgG1-4 antibodies against wild-type human prion protein. Multivariate linear regression models were constructed to analyze differences in autoantibody reactivity between a) PRNP mutation carriers versus controls and b) asymptomatic versus symptomatic PRNP mutation carriers. Robustness of results was examined in matched cohorts. Results. We found that antibody reactivity was present in a subset of both PRNP mutation carriers and controls. Autoantibody levels were not influenced by PRNP mutation status nor clinical manifestation of prion disease. Post hoc analyses showed anti-PrPC autoantibody titers to be independent of personal history of autoimmune disease and other immunological disorders, as well as PRNP codon 129 polymorphism. Conclusions. Pathogenic PRNP variants do not notably stimulate antibody-mediated anti-PrPC immunity. Anti-PrPC IgG autoantibodies are not associated with the onset of prion disease. The presence of anti-PrPC autoantibodies in the general population without any disease-specific association suggests that relatively high titers of naturally occurring antibodies are well tolerated.

19,10.1101/19007849,"Introduction Glucocorticoid (GC) administration is an effective therapy commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the use of GC can give rise to serious complications. The main detrimental side effect of GC therapy is significant bone loss, resulting in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). There are a variety of treatments available for preventing and managing GIOP; however, without clearly defined guidelines, it can be very difficult for physicians to choose the optimal therapy for their patients. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a NMA that incorporates all available RCT patient data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of all available GIOP treatments in terms of their ability to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and decrease fracture incidences among adult patients undergoing GC treatments. Methods and Analysis We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources (CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiresorptive regimens taken by adult patients undergoing GC therapy during the study or had taken GC for at least 3 months in the year prior to study commencement with lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD, total hip BMD, vertebral fracture incidences and/or non-vertebral fracture incidences as outcomes will be selected. We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias (ROB) will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using CINeMA in accordance to the GRADE framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report BMD results as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs), and we will report fracture incidences as odds ratios. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores to provide numerical estimations of the rankings of interventions. Ethics and Dissemination The study will not require ethical approval. The findings of the NMA will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of GIOP. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of bone loss and fractures associated with GIOP.

20,10.1101/19007914,"Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of complications and death following surgery. Pulmonary complications are particularly prominent. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a course of physical exercise and education that helps people with COPD manage their condition. Although proven to improve health outcomes in patients with stable COPD, it has never been formally tested as a pre-surgical intervention in patients scheduled for non-cardiothoracic surgery. If a beneficial effect were to be demonstrated, pulmonary rehabilitation for pre-surgical patients with COPD might be rapidly implemented across the National Health Service, as pulmonary rehabilitation courses are already well established across much of the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: We performed a feasibility study to test study procedures and barriers to identification and recruitment to a randomised controlled trial testing whether pulmonary rehabilitation, delivered before major abdominal surgery in a population of people with COPD, would reduce the incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications. This study was run in two UK centres (Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne). Results: We determined that a full randomised controlled trial would not be feasible, due to failure to identify and recruit participants. We identified an unmet need to identify more effectively patients with COPD earlier in the surgical pathway. Service evaluations suggested that barriers to identification and recruitment would likely be the same across other UK hospitals. Conclusions: Although pulmonary rehabilitation is a potentially beneficial intervention to prevent post-operative pulmonary complications, a randomised controlled trial is unlikely to recruit sufficient participants to answer our study question conclusively at the present time, when spirometry is not automatically conducted in all patients planned for surgery. As pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended treatment for all people with COPD, alternative study methods combined with earlier identification of candidate patients in the surgical pathway should be considered.

21,10.1101/19008102,"Background: Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are an established method for quantifying population health needs and guiding prioritisation decisions. Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates aim to ensure comparability between countries and over time by using age-standardised rates (ASR) to account for differences in the age structure of different populations. Different standard populations are used for this purpose but it is not widely appreciated that the choice of standard may affect not only the resulting rates but also the rankings of causes of DALYs. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the choice of standard, using the example of Scotland. Methods: Estimates of DALYs were derived from the 2016 Scottish Burden of Disease (SBOD) study for an abridged list of 68 causes of disease/injury, representing a three-year annual average across 2014-16. Crude rates of DALYs were calculated using Scottish national population estimates. ASR of DALYs standardised using the GBD World Standard Population (GBD WSP) were compared to those using the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP2013). Differences in ASR and in rank order within the cause list were summarised across all-causes and for each individual cause. Results: The ranking of causes by DALYs were similar using crude rates or ASR (ESP2013). As expected, rates using ASR (GBD WSP) were around 26% lower. Overall 58 out of 68 causes had a lower ASR using GBD WSP compared with ESP2013, with the largest falls occurring for leading causes of mortality observed in older ages. Gains in ASR were much smaller in scale and largely affected causes that operated early in life. These differences were associated with a substantial change to the ranking of causes when GBD WSP was used compared with ESP2013. Conclusion: Disease rankings based on ASR of DALYs are strongly influenced by the choice of standard population. While GBD WSP offers international comparability, within-country analyses based on ASR of DALYs should reflect local age structures. For European countries including Scotland ESP2013 may better reflect local disease patterns.",Copied,NA,0,0.082969432,keep,502,0.116524937,0,2,0,0,1,29634,medrxiv,16/10/2019,FALSE,How do World and European Standard Populations impact Burden of Disease studies?

22,10.1101/19008136,"Objectives: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) is an emerging treatment for multiple brain diseases, including the drug-resistant epilepsy Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We aimed to improve neurosurgical targeting of the CM by (i) developing a structural MRI approach for CM visualisation, (ii) identifying the CM's neurophysiological characteristics, and (iii) mapping connectivity from CM-DBS sites using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: Nineteen patients with LGS (mean age=28 years) underwent pre-surgical 3 tesla MRI using magnetisation-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) and fMRI sequences; 16 proceeded to bilateral CM-DBS implantation and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) from the thalamus. CM visualisation was achieved by highlighting intrathalamic borders on MP2RAGE using Sobel edge-detection. Mixed-effects analysis compared two MER features (spike firing rate, background noise) between ventrolateral, CM, and parafasicular nuclei. Resting-state fMRI connectivity was assessed using implanted CM-DBS electrode positions as regions-of-interest. Results: The CM appeared as a hyperintense region bordering the comparatively hypointense pulvinar, mediodorsal, and parafasicular nuclei. At the group-level, reduced spike firing and background noise distinguished CM from the ventrolateral nucleus; however, these trends were not found in 20-25% of individual MER trajectories. Areas of fMRI connectivity included basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, sensorimotor/premotor and limbic cortex. Conclusions: In the largest clinical trial cohort of LGS patients undergoing CM-DBS reported to date, we show that accurate targeting of the CM is achievable using 3 tesla MP2RAGE MRI. MERs may provide additional localising features in some cases, however their utility is limited by inter-patient variability.

Studies have focused on performance; however, no workflow assessments have been published comparing POC molecular tests. This study compared the Liat and ID Now systems workflow, to assist end-users in selecting an influenza and/or RSV POC test. Methods: Staffing, walk-away, and turnaround time (TAT) of the Liat and ID Now systems were determined using 40 nasopharyngeal samples, positive for influenza or RSV. The ID Now system requires separate tests for influenza and RSV, so parallel (two instruments) and sequential (one instrument) workflows were evaluated. Results: The ID Now ranged 4.1-6.2 minutes for staffing, 1.9-10.9 minutes for walk-away and 6.4-15.8 minutes for TAT per result. The Liat ranged 1.1-1.8 minutes for staffing, 20.0-20.5 minutes for walk-away and 21.3-22.0 minutes for TAT.

Although mannitol has historically been the most frequently administered, hypertonic saline (HTS) solutions are increasingly being used. However, definitive evidence regarding their comparative effectiveness is lacking. The Sugar or Salt (SOS) Trial is a UK randomised, allocation concealed open label multicentre pragmatic trial designed to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of hypertonic saline (HTS) compared with mannitol in the management of patients with severe TBI. Patients requiring intensive care unit admission and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring post-TBI will be allocated at random to receive equi-osmolar boluses of either mannitol or HTS following failure of routine first line measures to control ICP.

However, up to 50% of cases remain undiagnosed even upon periodic exome reanalysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can boost diagnostic yield in neuromuscular diseases, but its utility in neurodevelopmental disorders is hampered out of concern for sourcing relevant tissue for RNA analysis. Here we show human B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) share the transcriptional repertoire of brain tissue for a large subset of neurodevelopmental Mendelian genes, enabling testing of over 1000 genetic syndromes. LCLs also showed a 1.8-fold increase in the number of genes causing neurodevelopmental phenotypes when compared to whole blood (LCL, n = 1706; whole blood, n = 917) indicating a more robust testing landscape. We applied an RNA-seq diagnostic pipeline on LCLs from patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a rare multisystem neurodevelopment disorder and found 100% sensitivity for detection of abnormal splicing and 90% sensitivity for detecting all pathogenic events. Application of the pipeline on unsolved cases of CdLS revealed abnormal splicing and pathogenic coding variants in NIPBL and BRD4.

This is despite substantial evidence suggesting that early diagnosis and intervention improves developmental course and outcome. Objective: Develop a machine learning (ML) method predicting the diagnosis of ASD in offspring in a general population sample, using parental electronic medical records (EMR) available before childbirth Design: Prognostic study of EMR data within a single Israeli health maintenance organization, for the parents of 1,397 ASD children (ICD-9/10), and 94,741 non-ASD children born between January 1st, 1997 through December 31st, 2008. The complete EMR record of the parents was used to develop various ML models to predict the risk of having a child with ASD. Main outcomes and measures: Routinely available parental sociodemographic information, medical histories and prescribed medications data until offspring's birth were used to generate features to train various machine learning algorithms, including multivariate logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Prediction performance was evaluated with 10-fold cross validation, by computing C statistics, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false positive rate, and precision (positive predictive value, PPV). Results: All ML models tested had similar performance, achieving an average C statistics of 0.70, sensitivity of 28.63%, specificity of 98.62%, accuracy of 96.05%, false positive rate of 1.37%, and positive predictive value of 45.85% for predicting ASD in this dataset.

This heterogeneity complicates diagnosis, treatment, and the design and testing of new drugs. An important line of research is discovery of multimodal biomarkers that will facilitate the targeting of subpopulations with homogeneous pathophysiological signatures. High-throughput omics are unbiased data driven techniques that probe the complex etiology of Alzheimer's disease from multiple levels (e.g. network, cellular, and molecular) and thereby account for pathophysiological heterogeneity in clinical populations. This review focuses on data reduction analyses that identify complementary disease-relevant perturbations for three omics techniques: neuroimaging-based subtypes, metabolomics-derived metabolite panels, and genomics-related polygenic risk scores. Neuroimaging can track accrued neurodegeneration and other sources of network impairments, metabolomics provides a global small-molecule snapshot that is sensitive to ongoing pathological processes, and genomics characterizes relatively invariant genetic risk factors representing key pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease.

29,10.1101/19008953,"Background: The objective of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations for physical activity (PA) and PA promotion for German adults (18-65 years) with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Methods: The PA recommendations were developed based on existing PA recommendations and using a three-phased process. In phase 1, systematic literature searches were conducted for current PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions (osteoarthrosis of the hip and knee, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable ischemic heart disease, stroke, clinical depression, and chronic non-specific back pain). In phase 2, the PA recommendations were evaluated on the basis of 28 quality criteria. High-quality recommendations were identified, and a content analysis was conducted on these recommendations. In phase 3, the findings of the content analysis were summarised, and PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions were deducted. The seven recommendations were then synthesised to generate generic German PA recommendations for adults with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In relation to the recommendations for PA promotion, a systematic literature review was conducted on papers that reviewed the efficacy/effectiveness of interventions for PA promotion in adults with NCDs. Results: The German Recommendations for Physical Activity state that adults with NCDs should, over the course of a week, should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic PA, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA, or a combination of both. Furthermore, muscle-strengthening activities should be performed at least twice a week. The promotion of PA among adults with NCDs should be theory-based, specifically target PA behaviour, and be tailored to the respective target group. In this context, and as an intervention method, exercise referral schemes are one of the more promising methods of promoting PA in adults with NCDs. Conclusion: The development of evidence-based recommendations for PA and PA promotion is an important step in terms of the initiation and implementation of actions for PA-related health promotion in Germany. The German Recommendations for PA and PA promotion inform adults affected by NCDs and health professionals on how much PA would be optimal for adults with NCDs. Additionally, the recommendations provide professionals entrusted in PA promotion the best strategies and interventions to raise low PA levels in adults with NCDs.

30,10.1101/19009472,"Introduction. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) improves upper limb (UL) motor execution in unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). As these children also show motor planning deficits, action-observation training (AOT) might be of additional value. Here, we investigated the combined effect of AOT to CIMT and identified factors influencing treatment response. Methods. Forty-four children with uCP (mean 9y6m, SD 1y10m) participated in a 9-day camp wearing a splint for 6 hours/day and were allocated to the CIMT+AOT (n=22) and the CIMT+placebo group (n=22). The CIMT+AOT group received 15 hours of AOT (i.e. video-observation) and executed the observed tasks, whilst the CIMT+AOT group watched videos free of biological motion and executed the same tasks. The primary outcome measure was bimanual performance. Secondary outcomes included measures at body function and activity level assessed before (T1), after (T2) the intervention, and at 6 months follow-up (T3). Influencing factors included behavioural and neurological characteristics. Results. Although no between-groups differences were found (p>0.05), the addition of AOT led to higher gains in children with initially poorer bimanual performance (p=0.02). Both groups improved in all outcome measures after the intervention and retained the gains at follow up (p<0.01). Poor sensory function resulted in larger improvements in the total group (p=0.03) and high amount of mirror movements tended to result in better response to the additional AOT training (p=0.06). Improvements were similar irrespective of the type of brain lesion or corticospinal tract wiring pattern. Conclusions. Adding AOT to CIMT, resulted in better outcome for children with poor motor function and high amount of mirror movements. CIMT with or without AOT seems to be more beneficial for children with poor sensory function.

A key challenge is understanding the transmission pathways and mediating factors that characterized the patterns of dengue importation into non-endemic areas. Utilizing a network connectivity-based approach, we analyze the importation patterns of dengue fever into European countries. Seven connectivity indices were developed to characterize the role of the air passenger traffic, seasonality, incidence rate, geographical proximity, epidemic vulnerability, and wealth of a source country, in facilitating the transport and importation of dengue fever. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the relationship between dengue importation and the connectivity indices while accounting for the air transport network structure. We also incorporated network autocorrelation within a GLMM framework to investigate the propensity of a European country to receive an imported case, by virtue of its position within the air transport network. The connectivity indices and dynamical processes of the air transport network were strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe. With more than 70% of the variation in dengue importation patterns explained. We found that transportation potential was higher for source countries with seasonal dengue activity, high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, lower economic status, and geographical proximity to a destination country in Europe. We also found that position of a European country within the air transport network was a strong predictor of the country' propensity to receive an imported case. Our findings provide evidence that the importation patterns of dengue into Europe can be largely explained by appropriately characterizing the heterogeneities of the source, and topology of the air transport network.

Methods: We used survival analysis to assess retention at clinic level, Cox regression to examine risk factors for loss to follow up, and competing risk analysis to assess long-term outcomes of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results: We included 132,274 individuals in our analysis, totalling 270,256 person years of follow up (PYFU; median per patient 1.3, interquartile range (IQR) 0.26-3.1), 62% were female and the median age was 32 years.

ARTnet was designed to support prevention research for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are transmitted across partnership networks. ARTnet implemented a population-based egocentric network study design that sampled egos from the target population and asked them to report on the number, attributes, and timing of their sexual partnerships. Such data provide the foundation needed for estimating and simulating stochastic network models that are used for disease projection and intervention planning. ARTnet collected data online from 2017 to 2019, with a final sample of 4904 participants who reported on 16198 sexual partnerships. The analytic aims of the study were to characterize the joint distribution of three network parameters needed for modeling: degree distributions, assortative mixing, and partnership length, with heterogeneity by partnership type (main, casual and one-time), demography, and geography. Participants had an average of 1.19 currently active partnerships (""mean degree""), which was higher for casual partnerships (0.74) than main partnerships (0.45). The mean rate of one-time partnership acquisition was 0.16 per week (8.5 partners per year). Main partnerships lasted 272.5 weeks on average, while casual partnerships lasted 133.0 weeks. There was strong but heterogenous assortative mixing by race/ethnicity for all groups. The mean absolute age difference was 9.5 years, with main partners differing by 6.3 years compared to 10.8 years for casual partners. Our analysis suggests that MSM may be at sustained risk for HIV/STI acquisition and transmission through high network degree of sexual partnerships.

Here, we showed an association between age and log10-transformed DNA methylation outlier burden in a large cross-sectional cohort, the Generation Scotland Family Health Study (N=7,010, {beta}=0.0091, p<2x10-16), and in two longitudinal cohort studies, the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (N=430, {beta}=0.033, p=7.9x10-4) and 1936 (N=898, {beta}=7.9x10-3, p=0.074). Significant confounders of both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between outlier burden and age included white blood cell proportions, BMI, smoking, and batch effects. In Generation Scotland, the increase in epigenetic outlier burden with age was not purely an artefact of an increase in DNA methylation level variability with age (epigenetic drift). Log10-transformed DNA methylation outlier burden in Generation Scotland was not related to self-reported, or family history of, age-related diseases and it was not heritable (SNP-based heritability of 4.4%, p=0.18). Finally, DNA methylation outlier burden was not significantly related to survival in either of the Lothian Birth Cohorts individually but it was in a meta-analysis (HRmeta=1.12; 95%CImeta=[1.02; 1.21]; pmeta=0.021). These findings suggest that, while it does not associate with ageing-related health outcomes, DNA methylation outlier burden does track chronological ageing and may also relate to survival. DNA methylation outlier burden may thus be useful as a marker of biological ageing.",Copied,NA,0,0.048399488,keep,251,0.061715749,0,1,0,0,1,29745,medrxiv,02/11/2019,FALSE,"DNA methylation outlier burden, health and ageing in Generation Scotland and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936.",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,cc_by,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,genetic and genomic medicine,"Seeboth, A.; McCartney, D.

38,10.1101/19010975,"State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence methods are increasingly leveraged in clinical predictive modeling to provide clinical decision support systems to physicians. Modern ML approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and tree boosting often perform better than more traditional methods like logistic regression. On the other hand, these modern methods yield a limited understanding of the resulting predictions. However, in the medical domain, understanding of applied models is essential, in particular, when informing clinical decision support. Thus, in recent years, interpretability methods for modern ML methods have emerged to potentially allow explainable predictions paired with high performance. To our knowledge, we present in this work the first explainability comparison of two modern ML methods, tree boosting and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), to traditional logistic regression methods using a stroke outcome prediction paradigm. Here, we used clinical features to predict a dichotomized 90 days post-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. For interpretability, we evaluated clinical features importance with regard to predictions using deep taylor decomposition for MLP, shapley values for tree boosting and model coefficients for logistic regression. With regard to performance as measured by AUC values on the test dataset, all models performed comparably: Logistic regression AUCs were 0.82, 0.82, 0.79 for three different regularization schemes; tree boosting AUC was 0.81; MLP AUC was 0.81. Importantly, the interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across models by rating age and stroke severity consecutively amongst the most important predictive features. For less important features, some differences were observed between the methods. Our analysis suggests that modern machine learning methods can provide explainability which is compatible with domain knowledge interpretation and traditional method rankings. Future work should focus on replication of these findings in other datasets and further testing of different explainability methods.",Copied,NA,3,0.008890969,keep,38,0.009358914,0,2,0,0,1,29774,medrxiv,04/11/2019,FALSE,Opening the Black Box of Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Decision Support: A Study Predicting Stroke Outcome,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,cc_by_nc_nd,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,health informatics,"Zihni, E.; Madai, V.

39,10.1101/19011049,"Objectives: To compare the reproducibility of 11 antibody assays for IgG and IgM myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-IgG, MOG-IgM) from five international centers. Methods: The following samples were analyzed: MOG-IgG clearly positive sera (n=39), MOG-IgG low positive sera (n=39), borderline negative sera (n=13), clearly negative sera (n=40), and healthy blood donors (n=30). As technical controls, 18 replicates (9 MOG-IgG positive and 9 negative) were included. All samples and controls were re-coded, aliquoted, and distributed to the five testing centers which performed the following antibody assays: five live and one fixed immunofluorescence cell-based assays (CBA-IF, five MOG-IgG, one MOG-IgM), three live flow cytometry cell-based assays (FACS-CBA, all MOG-IgG), and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA, both MOG-IgG). Results: We found excellent agreement (96%) between the live CBAs for MOG-IgG for samples previously identified as clearly positive or negative from four different national testing centers. The agreement was lower with fixed CBA-IF (90%) and the ELISA showed no concordance with CBAs for detection of human MOG-IgG. All CBAs showed excellent inter-assay reproducibility. The agreement of MOG-IgG CBAs for borderline negative (77%) and particularly low positive (33%) samples was less good. Finally, most samples from healthy blood donors (97%) were negative for MOG-IgG in all CBAs.

40,10.1101/19011064,"Background: Madagascar has one of the highest rates of stunting and at-risk child development in the world:50% of Malagasy children have moderate to severe stunting. In 2016, a new 10 year National Nutrition Action Plan (PNAN III), supported by the World Bank, was initiated to help address stunting and developmental delay. PIVOT, a health care NGO operating in collaboration with the MOH, conducts a longitudinal study, the IHOPE, to assess the population level impact of their collaborative health system strengthening activities on the rural district of Ifanadiana in southeastern Madagascar. We report factors associated with risk to developmental delay in children ages 3 and 4 years old in Ifanadiana district in 2016. Methods: The household survey data are from a cross-sectional analysis of a one wave of panel data in 2016, at the time of the initiation of PNAN III. Women ages 15 to 49 were interviewed, using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) Early Child Development Indicator (ECDI) module, which includes questions for physical, socio-emotional, learning and literacy/numeracy domains. ECDI data were analyzed using standardized z scores for relative relationships. We assessed 2 outcomes: at risk for delayed development compared to an international standard, and lower development than peers if ECDI z scores were <1 standard deviation below the international normed population and study mean, respectively. Covariates included demographics (maternal age, education level, household wealth, number of other children under 5 in the house), adult involvement (reading, singing, playing with child), household environment (number and type of childrens books or toys, whether child was left alone or in the care of another child <10 years), and child health (wasting, stunting, underweight, ill in last 4 weeks, vaccination status). We included variables significant in univariable analysis at an alpha of <0.1 in a multivariable model. We constructed the final models using backward stepwise regression on generalized linear models, clustered at the sampling level. Results: Of 432 children ages 3 and 4 years, 173 were at risk for delay compared to international norms and 68 children (16.0%) were considered lower-development compared to their peers. 50.5% of the children had moderate to severe stunting and 19.0% had severe stunting. Greater paternal engagement (OR 1.59(1.13, 2.21)) was associated with being at risk for delay based on ECDI z scores <-1 compared to international norms Factors associated with lower risk for delay included having some adult play with the child and greater engagement from a non-parental adult. Factors associated with low development compared to peers included: under age 5 in the household, having a teenaged mother (age <20 years--OR3.89 (1.32, 11.48)), and having an adult who recently took the child outside. Factors associated with less developmental risk included increased number of developmentally stimulating activities by someone other than a parent(OR 0.28(0.16, 0.50)), and primary child toys are found objects rather than store bought or homemade(OR 0.33 (0.14, 0.73)). Discussion: In this setting of high malnutrition, stunting in children is not associated with lower-development compared to their peers, when adjusting for other factors. Families with teenaged mothers are more likely to have children with lower-development. Non-parent adult involvement seems very relevant to child development in this setting. Further research in the IHOPE longitudinal study may help to clarify direction of association.

Multiple factors contributed to malnutrition of HIV/AIDS patients and it need immediate identification and prompt action. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status of patients and identify factors associated with malnutrition among HIV/AIDS patients on follow-up care in Jimma medical center, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted from March-April, 2016. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical records of HIV/AIDS patients enrolled for follow up care in ART clinic from June 2010 to January 2016. Binary and multiple variable logistic regression was done to identify independent predictor of malnutrition. Results: Data of 971 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of under nutrition (BMI<18.5) was (36.8%) (95% CI: 33.8%-39.8%) and out of which severe malnutrition accounts 9.7%. Overweight and obese was 8.6%. Malnutrition was more likely among widowed patients (AOR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.034-2.798), patients in the WHO clinical AIDS staging of three (AOR=2.3, 95% CI, 1.392-3.693) and four (AOR=3.2, 95% CI, 1.667-5.943), patients with CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3 (AOR=2.0, 95% CI, 1.463-2.837) and patients with a functional status of bedridden (AOR=4.677, 95% CI, 1.761-12.419) and ambulatory (AOR=2.763, 95% CI, 1.833-4.165).

42,10.1101/19011213,"Abstract Background: Concern has been raised about consequences of including patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT) in readmission and mortality measures. Methods: We calculated unadjusted and hospital-specific 30-day risk-standardized mortality (RSMR) and readmission (RSRR) rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of AMI or HF discharged between July 2010 and June 2013. Hospitals were compared before and after excluding LVAD and HT patients. LVAD indication was measured. Results: For the AMI and HF cohorts, <0.2% of patients received an LVAD and <0.1% received HT in either cohort. Less than 2% of hospitals had either >6 patients who received an LVAD or, independently, had >1 HT. The AMI mortality and readmission cohorts used 1.8% and 2.8% of LVADs for semi-permanent/permanent indications, versus 73.8% and 78.0% for HF patients, respectively. The rest were for temporary/external indications. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without LVAD patients versus hospitals with >6 LVADs was 14.8% and 14.3%, and RSRR was 17.8% and 18.3%, respectively; the HF cohort RSMR was 11.9% and 9.7% and RSRR was 22.6% and 23.4%, respectively. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without versus with HT patients was 14.7% and 13.9% and RSRR was 17.8% and 17.7%, respectively; in the HF cohort, RSMR was 11.9% and 11.0%, and RSRR was 22.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Estimations changed <0.1% after excluding LVAD or HT patients. Conclusion: Hospitals caring for >6 patients with LVAD or >1 HT had lower RSMRs but higher RSRRs on average.

Yet, few studies have characterized phthalate exposures among this workforce. Objective: To characterize individual metabolites and cumulative phthalates exposure among a potentially vulnerable occupational group of nail salon workers. Study Design: We collected 17 post-shift urine samples from Vietnamese workers at six San Francisco Bay Area nail salons in 2011, which were analyzed for four primary phthalate metabolites: mono-n-butyl-, mono-isobutyl-, mono(2-ethylhexyl)-, and monoethyl phthalates (MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP, respectively) (g/L).

44,10.1101/19011577,"Leishmaniasis is a vector borne zoonosis which is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Among the three most common forms of the disease, Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most threatening to human health, causing 20,000 to 30,000 deaths worldwide each year. Areas where VL is mostly endemic have unprotected dogs in community and houses. The presence of dogs usually increases VL risk for humans since dogs are the principal reservoir host for the parasite of the disease. Based on this fact, most earlier studies consider culling dogs as a control measure for the spread of VL. A more recent control measure has been the use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars (DIDCs) to protect both humans and dogs by putting DIDCs on dogs neck. The presence of dogs helps to grow the sandfly population faster by offering a more suitable blood-meal source. On the other hand, the presence of DIDCs on dogs helps to reduce sandfly population by the lethality of deltamethrin insecticide. This study brings an ecological perspective to this public health concern, aiming to understand the impact of an additional host (here, protected dogs) on disease risk to a primary host (here, humans). To answer this question, we compare two different settings: a community without dogs, and a community with dogs protected with DIDC. Our analysis shows the presence of protected dogs can reduce VL infection risk in humans.

47,10.1101/19012112,"Background Intranasal administration of the prosocial neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects are currently lacking. Methods Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of four weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after four weeks of treatment (approximately 24 hours after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year post-treatment. Results No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social responsiveness scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (p= .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: p= .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviours (p= .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance towards others (p= .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to one month and even one year post-treatment.

48,10.1101/19012435,"Background: Asthma diagnosis in the community is often made without objective testing. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a stepwise objective diagnostic verification algorithm among patients with community-diagnosed asthma in the United States (US). Methods: We developed a probabilistic time-in-state cohort model that compared a stepwise asthma verification algorithm based on spirometry and methacholine challenge test against the current standard of care over 20 years. Model input parameters were informed from the literature and with original data analyses when required. The target population was US adults (15 y/o or older) with physician-diagnosed asthma. The final outcomes were costs (in 2018 $) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were undertaken to examine the effect of alternative assumptions and uncertainty in model parameters on the results. Results: In a simulated cohort of 10,000 adults with diagnosed asthma, the stepwise algorithm resulted in the removal of diagnosis in 3,366. This was projected to be associated with savings of $36.26 million in direct costs and a gain of 4,049.28 QALYs over 20 years. Extrapolating these results to the US population indicated an undiscounted potential savings of $56.48 billion over 20 years.

50,10.1101/19012880,"Background Stereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recently, stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias (stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR), with promising results reported in patients with refractory, scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT), a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality. Objective Herein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results. Methods This is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morphology, electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety. Results Five patients (100 % male, 63 ± 12 years old, 80 % ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction 34 ± 15 %) with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82 ± 11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12 ± 2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence; two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation. Conclusion Despite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up.

51,10.1101/19013318,"Background: Optimal ablation technique, including catheter-tissue contact during atrial fibrillation (AF) radiofrequency (RF) ablation is associated with improved procedural outcomes. We used a custom developed software to analyze high frequency catheter position data to study the interaction between catheter excursion during lesion placement, lesion-set sequentiality and arrhythmia recurrence. Methods: 100 consecutive patients undergoing first time RF ablation for paroxysmal AF were analyzed. Spatial positioning of the ablation catheter sampled at 60 Hz during RF application was extracted from the CARTO3 system (Biosense Webster Inc., USA) and analyzed using custom developed MATLAB software to determine precise catheter spatial 3D excursion during RF ablation. The primary end point was freedom from atrial arrhythmia lasting longer than 30 seconds after a single ablation procedure. Results: At one year, 86% of patients were free from recurrent arrhythmia. There was no significant difference in clinical, echocardiographic or ablation characteristics between patients with and without recurrent arrhythmia. Analyzing 15,356,998 position data-points revealed that lesion-set sequentiality and mean lesion catheter excursion were predictors of arrhythmia recurrence. Analyzing arrhythmia recurrence by mean single-lesion catheter excursion (excursion > 2.81mm) and by sequentiality (using 46% of lesions with inter-lesion distance >6mm as cutoff) revealed significantly increased arrhythmia recurrence in the higher excursion group (23% vs. 6%, p=0.03) and in the less sequential group (24% vs. 4%, p=0.02).

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wss1, the DNA-protein crosslink repair protease, allows cells to tolerate hydroxyurea-induced replication stress but the underlying mechanism by which Wss1 promotes this function has remained unknown. Here we report that Wss1 provides cells tolerance to replication stress by directly degrading core histone subunits that non-specifically and non-covalently bind to single-stranded DNA. Unlike Wss1-dependent proteolysis of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks, proteolysis of histones does not require Cdc48 nor SUMO-binding activities.

Recently, we showed that these effects are integrated to maintain transcription homeostasis: replicated genes increase in dosage, but their expression remains stable due to replication-dependent epigenetic changes that suppress transcription. Here, we examined whether reduced transcription from replicated DNA results from limited accessibility to regulatory factors, by measuring the time-resolved binding of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and specific transcription factors (TFs) to DNA during S phase in budding yeast. We show that RNAPII binding-pattern is largely insensitive to DNA dosage, indicating limited binding to replicated DNA.

Using network-based cortical thickness estimates from ultra-high field 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7T MRI), we investigated the structural correlates of pFTD. Methods: We obtained speech samples and 7T MRI anatomical scans from medicated clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (n=19) and healthy controls (n=20). Network-based morphometry was used to estimate the mean cortical thickness of 17 functional networks covering the entire cortical surface from each subject. We also quantified the vertexwise variability of thickness within each network to quantify the spatial coherence of the 17 networks, estimated patients vs. controls differences, and related the thickness of the affected networks to the severity of pFTD. Results: Patients had reduced thickness of the frontoparietal and default mode networks, and reduced spatial coherence affecting the salience and the frontoparietal control network. A higher burden of positive FTD related to reduced frontoparietal thickness and reduced spatial coherence of the salience network. The presence of positive FTD, but not its severity, related to the reduced thickness of the language network comprising of the superior temporal cortex.

The total cost of hypertension illness was estimated by summing up the direct and indirect costs. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with hypertension costs of illness. Results: Overall, the mean monthly total cost of hypertension illness was US $ 22.3 (95% CI, 21.3-23.3). Direct and indirect costs share 51% and 49% of the total cost, respectively.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.",Copied,NA,0,0.362788145,keep,1177,0.305708013,4,2,2,0,1,28450,biorxiv,19/12/2019,FALSE,Ca2+ ions promote fusion of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus with host cells and increase infectivity,1,7378,47,7,0,cc_by_nc_nd,new results,microbiology,"Straus, M.

Golden Promise is the cultivar most widely used for barley transformation and developing embryos are the most common donor tissue. We tested whether barley mutants with abnormally large embryos were more or less amenable to transformation and discovered that mutant M1460 had a transformation efficiencies similar to that of Golden Promise. The large-embryo phenotype of M1460 is due to mutation at the LYS3 locus. There are three other barley lines with independent mutations at the same LYS3 locus, and one of these, Riso1508 has an identical missense mutation to that in M1460. However, none of the lys3 mutants except M1460 were transformable showing that the locus responsible for transformation efficiency, TRA1, was not LYS3 but another locus unique to M1460. To identify TRA1, we generated a mapping population by crossing M1460 to the cultivar Optic, which is recalcitrant to transformation. After four rounds of backcrossing to Optic, plants were genotyped and their progeny were tested for transformability. Some of the progeny lines were transformable at high efficiencies similar to those seen for the parent M1460 and some were not transformable, like Optic.

The Ethiopian National Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and the Global Vaccine Action Plan set coverage goals of 90% at national level and 80% at district level by 2020. This study aims to analyse basic vaccination coverage among children in Ethiopia and to estimate the equity impact by socioeconomic, geographic, maternal and child characteristics based on data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016. Methods: Basic vaccination coverage (1-dose BCG, 3-doses DPT-HepB-Hib, 3-doses polio, 1-dose measles vaccine) of 2,004 children aged 12-23 months was analysed. Mean coverage was disaggregated by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (area of residence, region), maternal (maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal marital status, sex of household head) and child (sex of child, birth order) characteristics. Concentration indices assessed wealth and education-related inequalities. Multiple logistic regression estimated associations between basic vaccination coverage and socioeconomic, maternal and child characteristics. Results: National coverage for basic vaccinations was 39.7% in 2016. Single vaccination coverage ranged between between 53.2% (DTP3) and 69.2% (BCG). Wealth and maternal education related inequities were present for all vaccines. Children from richer households, urban regions, primary maternal education and male headed households were associated with higher vaccination coverage. The Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey 2019 reports national coverage for basic vaccinations at 43.3% with single vaccination coverage ranging between 57.8% (measles) and 74.2% (BCG). Conclusions: Vaccination coverage has improved from 2016 to 2019, but remains below the coverage goals of the EPI. Low vaccination coverage is associated with poorer households, rural regions of Afar and Somali, no maternal education and female headed households.

Methods: Assessment of the drug pipeline through analysis of the FDA database for orphan drug designations with descriptive and comparative statistics. Results: Between 1983 and 2019, 124 orphan drug designations were granted by the FDA for compounds intended to treat 28 lysosomal storage diseases. Orphan drug designations focused on Gaucher disease (N=16), Pompe disease (N=16), Fabry disease (N=10), MPS II (N=10), MPS I (N=9), and MPS IIIA (N=9), and included enzyme replacement therapies, gene therapies, and small molecules, and others. Twenty-three orphan drugs were approved for the treatment of 11 LSDs.

For host and parasite communities in the Southern Ocean, investigations of many major groups of parasites have largely been limited to taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, creating an urgent need for the collection of baseline ecological data if we are to detect changes in host-parasite interactions in the future. Here, we survey three species of Crocodile icefish (Notothenioidei: Channichthyidae) collected from two island archipelagos in Antarcticas South Scotia Arc region for evidence of leech infestations. Specifically, we report on infestation prevalence and intensity of three leech species (Trulliobdella bacilliformis, Trulliobdella capitis, and Nototheniobdella sawyeri) on the host fish species Chaenocephalus aceratus, Champsocephalus gunnari, and Chionodraco rastrospinosus. Additionally, we characterize spatial patterns of relative abundances of each leech species across the Elephant and South Orkney Islands, size distribution of parasitized fish, and patterns of host and attachment site specificity. Our results reveal high levels of attachment area fidelity for each leech species. These results suggest skin thickness and density of the vascular network constrain leech attachment sites and further suggest trophic transmission to be an important axis of parasitization. We also demonstrate that, while leech species appear to be clustered spatially, this clustering does not appear to be correlated with fish biomass.

Neurodegeneration and pathological aggregation of tau protein in the locus coeruleus are early features of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This pathology is proposed to contribute to the clinical expression of disease, including the PSP Richardson's syndrome. We test the hypothesis that tau pathology and neuronal loss are associated with clinical heterogeneity and severity in PSP. We used immunohistochemistry in post mortem tissues from 31 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PSP (22 with Richardson's syndrome) and 6 control cases. We quantified the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, the number of pigmented cells indicative of noradrenergic neurons, and the percentage of pigmented neurons with tau-positive inclusions. Ante mortem assessment of clinical severity using the PSP rating scale was available within 1.8 ({+/-}0.9) years for 23 patients. We found an average 49 percent reduction of pigmented neurons in PSP patients relative to controls. The loss of pigmented neurons correlated with disease severity, even after adjusting for disease duration and the interval between clinical assessment and death. The degree of neuronal loss was associated with tau-positive inclusions, with an average of 44% of pigmented neurons displaying tau-inclusions. Degeneration and tau pathology in the locus coeruleus are related to clinical heterogeneity of PSP.

68,10.1101/2020.01.13.905190,"Factor VIII (FVIII) is the coagulation factor deficient in hemophilia A, which is treated by protein replacement. Unfortunately, this regimen is costly due to the expense of producing recombinant FVIII as a consequence of its low level secretion. FVIII expression activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, causes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis. Importantly, little is known about the factors that cause protein misfolding and aggregation in metazoans. Here we identified intrinsic and extrinsic factors that cause FVIII to form aggregates in the ER. We show that FVIII forms amyloid-like fibrils within the ER upon increased FVIII synthesis or inhibition of glucose metabolism. Significantly, FVIII amyloids can be dissolved upon restoration of glucose metabolism to produce functional secreted FVIII. Two ER chaperones and their co-chaperones, BiP and CANX/CRT, promote FVIII solubility in the ER, where the former is also required for disaggregation. A short aggregation motif in the FVIII A1 domain (termed Aggron) is necessary and sufficient to seed {beta}-sheet polymerization and BiP binding to this Aggron prevents amyloidogenesis. Our findings provide novel insight into mechanisms that limit FVIII secretion and ER protein folding in general and have implication for ongoing hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials.

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.

Somatic mutations in STK11 and KEAP1, frequently co-mutated in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, have been associated with poor response to immune checkpoint blockade. However, previous reports lack non-immune checkpoint blockade controls needed to properly ascertain the predictive nature of those biomarkers. Objective: To evaluate the predictive vs prognostic effect of STK11 or KEAP1 mutations across different treatment classes in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Methods Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 21, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (?), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.

Findings The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10) associated with 0-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. With rising report rate, the mean R0 is likely to be below 5 but above 3.

Conclusion The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10), and significantly larger than 1.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.
 
 
 
 
 
 MethodsPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.
 
 
 
 
 
 ResultsOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.
 
 
 
 
 
 ConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to 2019-nCoV proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available 2019-nCoV sequences (as of 29 January 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against 2019-nCoV. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against 2019-nCoV.",Copied,NA,1,0.429269997,keep,578,0.19455117,2,1,0,0,1,33065,biorxiv,04/02/2020,TRUE,Preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for 2019-nCoV based on SARS-CoV immunological studies,4,3308,34,5,7,cc_by_nc,new results,bioinformatics,"Ahmed, S.

We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies.

We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection.

They may also reveal disease mechanisms that could be a target for therapy. In this study we looked for blood-based biomarkers in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Methods: Plasma metabolomic profiles were measured from 134 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n=30, non fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n=26, progressive supranuclear palsy n=45, corticobasal syndrome n=33) and 32 healthy controls. Results: Forty-nine of 842 metabolites were significantly altered in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons). These were distributed across a wide range of metabolic pathways including amino acids, energy and carbohydrate, cofactor and vitamin, lipid and nucleotide pathways. The metabolomic profile supported classification between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and controls with high accuracy (88.1-96.6%) while classification accuracy was lower between the frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes (72.1-83.3%). One metabolic profile, comprising a range of different pathways, was consistently identified as a feature of each disease versus controls: the degree to which a patient expressed this metabolomic profile was associated with their subsequent survival (hazard ratio 0.74 [0.59-0.93], p=0.0018).

Methods Policy review using government websites and shortage analysis using mathematical modelling based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Peoples Republic of China. Findings Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both the healthcare workers and the general population if the NCP outbreak only occurred in Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in both Hubei and Guangdong provinces, facemask supplies in the whole of China could last for 34 days if no alternative public health intervention was introduced. There would be a shortage of 480 million facemasks by mid-February 2020. If the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies could only last for 16 days and the shortage would considerably worsen, with a shortage of 11.5 billion facemasks by mid-February 2020. Interpretation In light of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, insufficient medical resources (e.g., shortage of facemasks) can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. An effective public health intervention should also consider the adequacy and affordability of existing medical resources.

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) for Hubei from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infection, recovery and mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, we have repeated the calculations under a scenario that considers five times the number of confirmed infected cases and eight times the number of recovered. Our computations and analysis were based on a mean field Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be 2.5, while the one computed by the official counts of the confirmed cases from the 11th of January until the 18th of January was found to be 4.6. Furthermore, on the estimated parameters from both scenarios, we provide tentative three-week forecasts of the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the cumulative number of infected will surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of current data and estimations on the official count of infected people in the population, the death toll might exceed 7,000 by February 29; however, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the mortality rate to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but also a high underestimation of the number of infected and recovered people in the population, which will hopefully lower the death toll.",Copied,NA,0,0.653298836,keep,2836,0.550175568,5,5,7,2,2,63169,medrxiv,13/02/2020,TRUE,"Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,cc_by_nc_nd,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,infectious diseases,"Anastassopoulou, C.; Russo, L.; Tsakris, A.; Siettos, C.",4,Constantinos Siettos,University of Naples Federico II,1,PHRASE,University of Naples Federico II,Italy,IT,10.1371/journal.pone.0230405,"Data-based analysis, modelling and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak",31/03/2020,PLOS ONE,Public Library of Science (PLoS),47,TRUE,gold,TRUE

Imported cases and small transmission clusters have been reported globally. Early data suggest the virus transmits readily and a pandemic cannot be ruled out. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43). We use these data to explore the effect of seasonal variation in transmissibility on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A model allowing for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters of SARS-CoV-2 spread shows how a pandemic could unfold in 2020-2022. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a peak in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in winter 2020/2021. A smaller range of parameters suggests a peak in the first half of 2020 or two peaks of similar magnitude. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission.

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-? levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases.

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.

101,10.1101/2020.02.17.952903,"Since December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has hit the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province. With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.",Copied,NA,2,0.978324546,keep,2117,0.584651435,9,2,7,0,1,34725,biorxiv,21/02/2020,TRUE,Molecular mechanism of evolution and human infection with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),1,3303,36,2,3,cc_by_nc,new results,microbiology,"He, J.; Tao, H.; Yan, Y.; Huang, S.-Y.; Xiao, Y.",5,Sheng-You Huang,"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",1,PHRASE,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,China,CN,10.3390/v12040428,Molecular Mechanism of Evolution and Human Infection with SARS-CoV-2,13/04/2020,Viruses,MDPI AG,52,TRUE,gold,TRUE

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness.

Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs.

FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission, characterized by an increased of ??????alt, ast, GGT, AKP?. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay.

In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R>1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020.

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006).

Early studies of the urinary microbiota preferentially used samples obtained by transurethral catheterization to minimize vulvo-vaginal microbial contributions. Whereas voided specimens are preferred for longitudinal studies, the few studies that reported longitudinal data were limited to women with lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms, due to ease of accessing a clinical population for sampling and the impracticality and risk of collecting repeated catheterized urine specimens in a non-clinical population. Here, we studied the microbiota of the LUT of non-symptomatic, pre-menopausal women using mid-stream voided urine (MSU) specimens to investigate relationships between microbial dynamics and personal factors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and a metaculturomics method called Expanded Quantitative Urine Culture (EQUC), we characterized the microbiotas of MSU and peri-urethral swab specimens collected daily for approximately three months from a small cohort of adult women. Participants were screened for eligibility, including ability to self-collect paired urogenital specimens prior to enrollment. In this population, we found that measures of microbial dynamics related to specific participant-reported factors, particularly menstruation and vaginal intercourse. Further investigation of the trends revealed differences in composition and diversity of LUT microbiotas within and across participants.

The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R?0<?1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (R?0<?1). With the emergence of the novel viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. We come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people.

Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak.

Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model. The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rC, and exclusion rate rE. These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient ? describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E0 exp(?,t) with ? = ln?. The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rC can be reduced by quarantine, while rE can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rC/rE has to be reduced to 1. Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases. In contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, Italian provinces on February 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of rC/rE and corresponding decrease of ? from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. Even higher reduction should take place in France, Germany and Spain for which ? > 1.3 (as of March 10, 2020). Considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which rE decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. In such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years.

Human behavior is influenced by people's knowledge and perceptions. Objective: To determine knowledge and perceptions of Covid-19 among the general public in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Design: Cross-sectional online survey conducted between February 23rd and March 3rd 2020. Setting: Online. Participants: A sample of 3,000 adults residing in the US and 3,000 adults residing in the UK who were representative of the general population by age, sex, ethnicity, education, and household income. Measurements: Response to 21 survey questions. Results: 2,987 of 3,000 US and 2,978 of 3,000 UK adults completed the questionnaire (response rate of 99.4%). The median estimate by participants for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with Covid-19 was 4.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 10.0%). Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 33.8% (95% CI: 32.6% - 35.0%) of participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was ""highly effective"" in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 27.6% (95% CI: 26.5% - 28.7%) of participants thought it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. In addition, 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% - 31.3%) of US participants and 40.7% (95% CI: 39.0% - 42.5%) of UK participants stated that if they were an Uber driver, they would at least sometimes refuse rides to passengers with East Asian-sounding names to reduce their risk of infection. 46.6% (95% CI: 45.3% - 47.8%) of participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death from Covid-19. Limitation: While participants were representative of the UK and US adult population by age, sex, ethnicity, household income, and education, they may not be representative by other (unobserved) characteristics. Conclusion: These findings can guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media.

In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in complex with CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient. CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding site can only be accessed when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the ""up"" conformation.

Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated. Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively.

We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design: Rapid evidence review. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results: We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.

Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not reported.

This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52 (0.66) log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70 (0.51) CPM , p=.000762). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=negative 0.24; p=0.035). Current smoking also significantly increased ACE2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77 (90.91) CPM versus smokers=1.78 (0.39) CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two external cohorts. Conclusions: ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.",Copied,Not clear if abstract or 1st paragraph,2,0.883121348,exclude,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,63962,medrxiv,23/03/2020,TRUE,ACE-2 Expression in the Small Airway Epithelia of Smokers and COPD Patients: Implications for COVID-19,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,cc_by_nc_nd,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,respiratory medicine,"Leung, J.

The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020. Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.

This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections.

Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included. Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020. Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance. Results: 1916 titles were screened. Of these, 15 studies describing 19 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; nine diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (seven of which were deep learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and seven prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, or length of hospital stay. None of the 15 studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Predictors included in more than one of the 19 models were: age, sex, comorbidities, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte markers (percentage or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), lactate dehydrogenase, and features derived from CT images. Reported C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to > 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 5 of the 9 diagnostic models), and from 0.90 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 4 of the 7 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion: COVID-19 related prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis are quickly entering the academic literature through publications and preprint reports, aiming to support medical decision making in a time where this is needed urgently. Many models were poorly reported and all appraised as high risk of bias. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies worldwide to support collaborative efforts in building more rigously developed and validated COVID-19 related prediction models.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.

Objective To determine whether saving in reagents for detection of SARS CoV-2 can be accomplished using the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens in a public health laboratory. Design The most efficient specimen pool size was determined using a web-based application. Parameters affecting the optimal pool size of 5 specimens were: prevalence rate of 5%, a lower limit of detection of 1 to 3 RNA copies per microliter, sensitivity and specificity of 100%, two-stage pooling algorithm, and a range of pool sizes of 3 to 10 samples. Experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from each confirmed nasopharyngeal positive patient specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) for a total volume of 250 microliter. Viral RNA was then extracted from each pool and subsequently tested with the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay that was developed by the CDC and used according to the instructions of manufacturer. Setting Studies were conducted in the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory with samples collected from individual patients throughout the state. Participants A total of 21 SARS CoV-2 confirmed positive samples and 84 SARS CoV-2 confirmed negative samples were used to create 21 pools.

First, we use an in vitro reconstituted yeast translation system to demonstrate that inhibitory codon pairs slow elongation rates which are partially rescued by increased tRNA concentration or by an artificial tRNA not dependent on wobble base pairing. Ribosome profiling data extend these observations by revealing that paused ribosomes with empty A sites are enriched on these sequences. Cryo-EM structures of stalled ribosomes provide a structural explanation for the observed effects by showing decoding-incompatible conformations of mRNA in the A sites of all studied stall-inducing sequences.

We propose a novel modular refinement approach that helps finding functionally significant modules of molecular networks. The module refinement algorithm improves the quality of topological modules in protein-protein interaction networks by finding biologically functionally significant modules. The algorithm is based on the fact that functional modules in biology do not necessarily represent those corresponding to maximum modularity. Larger modules corresponding to maximal modularity are incrementally re-modularized again under specific constraints so that smaller yet topologically and biologically valid modules are recovered. We show improvement in quality and functional coverage of modules using experiments on synthetic and real protein-protein interaction networks. Results were also compared with six existing methods available for clustering biological networks.

This compound library comprises of 400 drugs against neglected tropical diseases, including 125 with antimalarial activity. For this screen, we utilised transgenic parasites expressing a bioluminescent reporter, Nanoluciferase (Nluc), to measure inhibition of parasite egress and invasion in the presence of the Pathogen Box compounds. At a concentration of 2 {micro}M, we found 15 compounds that inhibited parasite egress by >40% and 24 invasion-specific compounds that inhibited invasion by >90%. We further characterised 11 of these inhibitors through cell-based assays and live cell microscopy and found two compounds that inhibited merozoite maturation in schizonts, one compound that inhibited merozoite egress, one compound that directly inhibited parasite invasion and one compound that slowed down invasion and arrested ring formation. The remaining compounds were general growth inhibitors that acted during the egress and invasion phase of the cell cycle. We found the sulfonylpiperazine, MMV020291, to be the most invasion-specific inhibitor, blocking successful merozoite internalisation within human RBCs and having no substantial effect on other stages of the cell cycle. This has greater implications for the possible development of an invasion-specific inhibitor as an antimalarial in a combination based therapy, in addition to being a useful tool for studying the biology of the invading parasite.\n\nImportancePlasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria and with emerging resistance to frontline treatments, there is the need to identify new drug targets in the parasite. One of the most critical processes during the asexual blood stage in the parasites lifecycle is the egress from old red blood cells (RBCs) and subsequent invasion of new RBCs. Many unique parasite ligands, receptors and enzymes are employed during egress and invasion that are essential for parasite proliferation and survival, therefore making these processes druggable targets. Identifying novel compounds that inhibit these essential processes would further their development into possible antimalarials that would be highly effective at killing asexual RBC stage parasites when used in combination with drugs that target the intraerythrocytic growth phase.

Here we report the expression patterns of the evolutionarily conserved anterior (otx, gsc, six3/6, nk2.1), posterior (cdx, bra) and endomesodermal (foxA, gata4/5/6, twist) markers in the phoronid Phoronopsis harmeri.\n\nResultsThe transcription factors foxA, gata4/5/6 and cdx show conserved expression in patterning the development and regionalization of the phoronid embryonic gut, with foxA expressed in the presumptive foregut, gata4/5/6 demarcating the midgut and cdx confined to the hindgut. Surprisingly, brachyury, an evolutionary conserved transcription factor often associated with gastrulation movements and patterning of the mouth and hindgut, seems to be unrelated with gastrulation and mouth patterning in phoronids. Furthermore, six3/6, a well-conserved anterior marker, shows a remarkably dynamic expression, demarcating not only the apical organ and the oral ectoderm, but also clusters of cells of the developing midgut and the anterior mesoderm, similar to what has been reported for brachiopods, bryozoans and some deuterostome Bilateria.\n\nConclusionsOur comparison of gene expression patterns with other studied Bilateria reveals that the timing of axis determination and cell fate distribution of the phoronid shows highest similarities to rhynchonelliform brachiopods.

183,10.1101/785691,"The evolution of bacterial regulatory networks has largely been explained at macroevolutionary scales through lateral gene transfer and gene duplication. Transcription factors (TF) have been found to be less conserved across species than their target genes (TG). This would be expected if TFs accumulate mutations faster than TGs. This hypothesis is supported by several lab evolution studies which found TFs to be frequently mutated. Despite these studies, the contribution of point mutations in TFs to the evolution of regulatory network, especially at microevolutionary scales is poorly understood. We tested if TFs show greater sequence diversity than their TGs using whole-genome sequencing data on thousands of clinical and environmental isolates of E coli. We found that TFs were less diverse in sequence than their TGs, and that their diversity was constrained by their regulatory roles. Over longer time-scales, the conservation of TFs, other than global regulators (GR), was low across species. Over very short time-scales represented by lab evolution studies, we confirmed an excess of beneficial mutations in TFs. TFs accumulated mutations much faster than TGs in the first 10,000 generations of a long-term evolution experiment. However, as evolution proceeded, mutations appeared in TFs at rates similar to or lower than those in TGs. Our results suggest that point mutations, conferring large-scale expression changes, may drive the early stages of adaptation but gene regulation is subjected to stronger purifying selection post adaptation.

Tolerance to herbivory and ambient herbivore damage on the other hand, did not differ between widespread and rare species. In accordance to the resource-availability hypothesis, widespread species from resource rich habitats where more damaged by herbivores (less defended) than widespread species from resource poor habitats - such a growth-defense tradeoff was lacking in rare species. This indicates that the evolutionary important tradeoff between traits increasing competitive-ability and defence is present in widespread species but may have been lost in rare species.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results indicate that biotic interactions, above all competition, might indeed set range limits, and underlines the importance of including context-dependency in studies comparing traits of common and rare or invasive and non-invasive species.",Copied,NA,0,0.22596415,keep,292,0.083107007,0,1,0,0,1,21593,biorxiv,02/10/2019,FALSE,Context dependency of biotic interactions and its relation to plant rarity,1,5328,55,3,1,cc_by_nc_nd,new results,ecology,"Kempel, A.; Vincent, H.; Prati, D.; Fischer, M.",4,Anne Kempel,University of Bern,1,PHRASE,University of Bern,Switzerland,CH,10.1111/ddi.13050,Context dependency of biotic interactions and its relation to plant rarity,06/03/2020,Diversity and Distributions,Wiley,156,TRUE,gold,TRUE
185,10.1101/793000,"ObjectiveRates of overweight and obesity epidemic have risen significantly in the past few decades, and 34% of adults and 15-20% of children and adolescents in the United States are now obese. Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti-obesity treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in obesity and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of obesity is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent pathways involved in bodyweight homeostasis and Obesity.\n\nMethodsTo evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE metabolic cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).\n\nResultsWe found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced obesity models compared to controls, 2) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, 5) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.\n\nConclusionsBased on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by metabolic cues and involved in metabolic receptor endocytosis.

187,10.1101/797183,"As development proceeds, inductive cues are interpreted by competent tissues in a spatially and temporally restricted manner. While key inductive signaling pathways within competent cells are well-described at a molecular level, the mechanisms by which tissues lose responsiveness to inductive signals are not well understood. Localized activation of Wnt signaling before zygotic gene activation in Xenopus laevis leads to dorsal development, but competence to induce dorsal genes in response to Wnts is lost by the late blastula stage. We hypothesize that loss of competence is mediated by changes in histone modifications leading to a loss of chromatin accessibility at the promoters of Wnt target genes. We use ATAC-seq to evaluate genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility across several developmental stages. Based on overlap with p300 binding, we identify thousands of putative cis-regulatory elements at the gastrula stage, including sites that lose accessibility by the end of gastrulation and are enriched for pluripotency factor binding motifs. Dorsal Wnt target gene promoters are not accessible after the loss of competence in the early gastrula while genes involved in mesoderm and neural crest development maintain accessibility at their promoters. Inhibition of histone deacetylases increases acetylation at the promoters of dorsal Wnt target genes and extends competence for dorsal gene induction by Wnt signaling. Histone deacetylase inhibition, however, is not sufficient to extend competence for mesoderm or neural crest induction.

188,10.1101/813378,"Purpose miR-375 is a highly abundant miRNAs in Merkel cell carcinoma. miR-375 may act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the cell context. While miR-375 is present as circulating free in the serum of patients with advanced MCC and thus serves as surrogate marker for tumor burden, its function within MCC has not been established.

Methods miR-375 knockdown was performed using miR-375 antagomiRs via lipofectamine transfection or nucleofection in classical MCC cell lines WaGa and PeTa. Viability and both changes in growth characteristics as well as morphology were determined. Genes targeted by miR-375 were predicted using ENCORI; based on these miR-375 regulated signaling pathways were determined by genes ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Expression of these genes was analyzed by multiplexed RT-qPCR to check the effect of miR-375 knockdown on these signaling pathways.

Results Complete knockdown of miR-375 expression by antagomiRs was only achieved by using nucleofection. This knockdown did not affect cell growth pattern, morphology, or proliferative capacity. miR-375 predicted target genes GO analysis revealed that Hippo signaling and focal adhesion-related genes were likely to be regulated by miR-375. GSEA of gene expression data of MCC cell lines further strengthened the regulation of Focal adhesion-related genes by miR-375. However, gene expression analysis revealed that miR-375 knockdown had only a limited effect on expression of these pathways related genes.

192,10.1101/832675,"The tricarboxylic acid cycle is a central metabolic hub in most cells. Virulence functions of bacterial pathogens such as facultative intracellular Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) are closely connected to cellular metabolism. During systematic analyses of mutant strains with defects in TCA cycle, a strain deficient in all fumarase isoforms ({Delta}fumABC) elicited a unique metabolic profile. Alongside fumarate STM {Delta}fumABC accumulates intermediates of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. Analyses by metabolomics and proteomics revealed that fumarate accumulation redirects carbon fluxes towards glycogen synthesis due to high (p)ppGpp levels. In addition, we observed reduced abundance of CheY, leading to altered motility and increased phagocytosis of STM by macrophages. Deletion of glycogen synthase restored normal carbon fluxes and phagocytosis, and partially levels of CheY. We propose that utilization of accumulated fumarate as carbon source induces a status similar to exponential to stationary growth phase transition by switching from preferred carbon sources to fumarate, which increases (p)ppGpp levels and thereby glycogen synthesis. Thus, we observed a new form of interplay between metabolism of STM, and cellular functions and virulence.\n\nImportanceWe performed perturbation analyses of the tricarboxylic acid cycle of the gastrointestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The defect of fumarase activity led to accumulation of fumarate, but also resulted in a global alteration of carbon fluxes, leading to increased storage of glycogen. Gross alterations were observed in proteome and metabolome compositions of fumarase-deficient Salmonella. In turn, these changes were linked to aberrant motility patterns of the mutant strain, and resulted in highly increased phagocytic uptake by macrophages.

193,10.1101/838821,"Ribosome biogenesis is tightly regulated through stress-sensing pathways that impact genome stability, aging and senescence. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosomal RNAs are transcribed from rDNA located on the right arm of chromosome XII. Numerous studies reveal that rDNA decondenses into a puff-like structure during interphase and condenses into a tight loop-like structure during mitosis. Intriguingly, a novel and additional mechanism of increased mitotic rDNA compaction (termed hypercondensation) was recently discovered that occurs in response to temperature stress (hyperthermic-induced) and is rapidly reversible. Here, we report that neither changes in condensin nor cohesin binding dynamics appear to play a critical role in hyperthermic-induced rDNA hypercondensation - differentiating this architectural state from normal mitotic condensation (requiring cohesins and condensins) and the premature condensation (requiring condensins) that occurs during interphase in response to nutrient starvation. A candidate genetic approach revealed that deletion of either Hsp82 or Hsc82 (Hsp90 heat shock paralogs) result in significantly reduced hyperthermic-induced rDNA hypercondensation. Intriguingly, Hsp inhibitors do not impact rDNA hypercondensation. In combination, these findings suggest that Hsp90 either stabilizes client proteins, which are sensitive to very transient thermic challenges, or directly promotes rDNA hypercondensation during preanaphase.

Early multiclonal invasion in the majority of these tumors indicates the expansion of co-evolving subclones with similar malignant potential in absence of late bottlenecks, and suggests that barriers to invasion are minimal during colorectal cancer growth.",Copied,NA,1,0.003131991,keep,7,0.003131991,0,0,0,0,0,25451,biorxiv,14/11/2019,FALSE,Minimal Barriers to Invasion During Human Colorectal Tumor Growth,1,3624,34,5,1,cc_no,new results,cancer biology,"Ryser, M.

196,10.1101/852541,"Trophic interactions can result in changes to the abundance and distribution of habitat-forming species that dramatically reduce ecosystem health and functioning. Nowhere may this be as dramatic as in the coastal zone of the Aleutian Archipelago, where overgrazing by herbivorous sea urchins that began in the 1980s resulted in widespread deforestation of the regions kelp forests. Here we show that this deforestation resulted in decreased macroalgal and invertebrate abundance and diversity, increased benthic irradiances, and reduced rates of gross primary production and respiration by the ecosystem. These opposing metabolic processes remain in balance, however, which resulted in little-to-no changes to net ecosystem production. These patterns were consistent across nine islands spanning more than 1000 kilometers of the archipelago. In light of the worldwide declines in kelp forests observed in recent decades, our findings suggest that marine deforestation profoundly affects the health of coastal ecosystems and how they function.

197,10.1101/859892,"The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene is responsible for telomere maintenance in germline and stem cells, and is re-expressed in 90% of human cancers. Contrary to common concepts, CpG methylation in the TERT promoter (TERTp), was correlated with TERT mRNA expression. Furthermore, two hotspot mutations in TERTp, dubbed C228T and C250T, have been revealed to assist binding of transcription factor ETS/TCF and subsequent TERT expression. This study aimed to elucidate the combined contribution of epigenetic (promoter methylation and higher-order chromatin structure) and genetic (promoter mutations) mechanisms in regulating TERT gene expression in healthy skin and in melanoma cell lines (n=61). We unexpectedly observed that the methylation of TERTp was as high in a subset of healthy skin cells, mainly keratinocytes, as in cutaneous melanoma cell lines. In spite of the high promoter methylation fraction in wild-type (WT) samples, TERT mRNA was only expressed in the melanoma cell lines with high methylation or intermediate methylation in combination with TERT mutations. TERTp methylation was positively correlated with chromatin accessibility and expression in 8 melanoma cell lines. Cooperation between epigenetic and genetic mechanisms were best observed in heterozygous mutant cell lines as chromosome accessibility preferentially concerned the mutant allele. Combined, these results suggest a complex model in which TERT expression requires either a widely open chromatin state throughout the promoter in TERTp-WT samples due to high methylation or a combination of moderate methylation fraction/chromatin accessibility in the presence of the C228T/C250T mutations.

198,10.1101/863167,"Isolation of high molecular weight DNA from gastropod molluscs and its subsequent PCR amplification is considered difficult due to excessive mucopolysaccharides secretion which co-precipitate with DNA and obstruct successful amplification. In an attempt to address this issue, we describe a modified CTAB DNA extraction method that proved to work significantly better with a number of freshwater and terrestrial gastropod taxa. We compared the performance of this method with Qiagen(R) DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. Reproducibility of amplification was verified using a set of taxon-specific primers wherein, modified CTAB extracted DNA could be replicated at least four out of five times but kit extracted DNA could not be replicated. Additionally, sequence quality was significantly better with CTAB extracted DNA. This could be attributed to the removal of polyphenolic compounds by polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) which is the only difference between conventional and modified CTAB DNA extraction methods for animals. The genomic DNA isolated using modified CTAB protocol was of high quality (A260/280 [&ge;] 1.80) and could be used for downstream reactions even after long term storage (more than two years).",Copied,NA,0,0.025833333,keep,47,0.020833333,0,0,0,0,0,27060,biorxiv,03/12/2019,FALSE,Comparison of DNA extraction methods for non-marine molluscs: Is modified CTAB DNA extraction method more efficient than DNA extraction kits?,1,1969,36,3,4,cc_by_nd,new results,molecular biology,"Chakraborty, S.; Saha, A.; Madhyastha, A.

199,10.1101/865089,"The pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI) remains poorly understood and treatment remains limited. Emerging evidence indicates the severity of post-SCI inflammation and an ongoing controversy in the roles of astrocytes with studies identifying astrocytes as associated both with ongoing inflammation and damage as well as potentially having a protective role. We have completed an extensive systematic study with MRI, histopathology, proteomics and ELISA analyses designed to further define the severe protracted and damaging inflammation after SCI in a rat model. We have identified 3 distinct phases of SCI: acute (first 2 days), inflammatory (starting day 3) and resolution (>3 months) in 16 weeks follow up. Actively phagocytizing, CD68+/CD163- macrophages infiltrate myelin-rich necrotic areas converting them into cavities of injury (COI) when deep in the spinal cord. Alternatively, superficial SCI areas are infiltrated by granulomatous tissue, or arachnoiditis where glial cells are obliterated. In the COI, CD68+/CD163- macrophage numbers reach a maximum in the first 4 weeks and then decline. Myelin phagocytosis is present at 16 weeks indicating ongoing inflammatory damage. The COI and arachnoiditis are defined by a wall of progressively hypertrophied astrocytes. MR imaging indicates persistent spinal cord edema that is linked to the severity of inflammation. Microhemorrhages in the spinal cord around the lesion are eliminated, presumably by reactive astrocytes within the first week post-injury. Acutely increased levels of TNF-, IL-1{beta}, IFN-{gamma} and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases decrease and anti-inflammatory cytokines increase in later phases. In this study we elucidated a number of fundamental mechanisms in pathogenesis of SCI and have demonstrated a close association between progressive astrogliosis and reduction in the severity of inflammation.",Copied,NA,0,0.09689408,keep,373,0.09689408,0,0,0,0,0,27166,biorxiv,04/12/2019,FALSE,Prolonged inflammation leads to ongoing damage after spinal cord injury.,1,6042,55,11,0,cc_by,new results,pathology,"Kwiecien, J.

200,10.1101/869313,"Colibactin is a genotoxic gut microbiome metabolite long suspected of playing an etiological role in colorectal cancer progression. Evidence suggests colibactin forms DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) in eukaryotic cells and activates ICL repair pathways, leading to the production of ICL-dependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here we show that colibactin ICLs can evolve directly to DNA DSBs. Using the topology of supercoiled plasmid DNA as a proxy for alkylation adduct stability, we show that colibactin-derived ICLs are unstable toward depurination and elimination of the 3' phosphate. This pathway leads progressively to the formation of nicks SSBs and cleavage DSBs and is consistent with the earlier determination that non-homologous end joining repair-deficient cells are sensitized to colibactin-producing bacteria. The results herein further our understanding of colibactin-derived DNA damage and underscore the complexities underlying the DSB phenotype.",Copied,NA,0,0.183425973,keep,234,0.122789288,1,0,0,0,1,27554,biorxiv,10/12/2019,FALSE,Depurination of colibactin-derived interstrand cross-links.,1,3696,32,9,0,cc_no,new results,microbiology,"Xue, M.; Wernke, K.; Herzon, S.",3,Seth Herzon,Yale University,1,PHRASE,Yale University,United States,US,10.1021/acs.biochem.9b01070,Depurination of Colibactin-Derived Interstrand Cross-Links,24/01/2020,Biochemistry,American Chemical Society (ACS),45,TRUE,hybrid,FALSE
